# What is JustText?

JustText is a simple project I created out of boredom. It's my very first real project, and I decided to go with a text editor because I find the concept of text editors pretty cool, and I thought building one would be a great learning experience.

Even though it’s simple, I made an effort to add some interesting features. The interface is actually quite pleasant, especially considering it’s entirely built with tkinter, which is a very limited tool.

I don’t have any plans for regular updates. I might add something here and there, but nothing consistent. However, in the future, I plan to rebuild it in a more "professional" and "serious" way using Visual Studio & C-Sharp for Desktop Applications.

## Features

- Interface inspired by Sublime 4
- Basic text editing tools
- Ability to edit multiple files simultaneously
- Lightweight and fast

## Installation

1. Download the executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/weslleytavars/JustText/releases).
2. Run `JustText.exe` to launch the app.

## Usage

JustText is very user-friendly. It’s pretty much like other text editors such as Sublime, Notepad++, or VSCode.

Here are some shortcuts you can use:

- ***[ Control + O ]*** Open a file
- ***[ Control + S ]*** Save the current file
- ***[ Control + Shift + S ]*** Save the current file with a custom name or location.

- ***[ Control + T ]*** Create a new blank tab
- ***[ Control + W ]*** Close the last opened tab
